<h1>The Best Programming Books You Need To Read</h1>
<div>
  <p>In this article, I share the 10 best programming books in 2024.

    But what do I mean by programming books? Well, rather than something language-specific, like books on Python programming, HTML, CSS, or Ruby, here I'll cover general programming books with information and skills you can apply in all languages.</p>
    <p></p>

    Whether you’re new to programming and fresh off a self-taught programming course or an experienced professional looking to boost your programming skills, I’ve included programming books for beginners and pros alike.

    Plus, with the Bureau of Labor and Statistics reporting an average salary of over $100K for programmers, picking up a programming book can be the first step to a financially rewarding career.

    So, if you’re ready, let’s dive into the best programming books to boost your skills.

<h2>1. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h2>
<p>Why we chose this book

  Taking the top spot on my list is Clean Code by Robert C. Martin, who you may also know as Uncle Bob.

  For me, this isn't just about programming but a definitive guide for any software development professional. I love Martin's approach to agile software craftsmanship, as he emphasizes the significance of clean, well-written code. This is like music to my ears!</p>
  <p> The idea is that he challenges you to reassess your professional values and dedication to the craft of programming. I also appreciate that the book is divided into three parts: foundational principles of clean coding, engaging case studies, and a final compilation of heuristics and code “smells.”

    I know, code smells?!
  </p>
  <p> But what sets this book apart is its comprehensive coverage. You will learn to discern between good and bad code, transform problematic code into high-quality code, and understand the essentials of creating effective names, functions, objects, and classes.

    Martin also has a nice writing style, and he places a strong emphasis on practicality, which is demonstrated by extensive code examples and real-world scenarios. This is a big plus point for me, as it means your theoretical knowledge is grounded in actual coding practices.

    If you want a 1-line review, Clean Code is indispensable for developing and maintaining high standards in software development.</p>
